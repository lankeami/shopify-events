# Create Release

Create a release for **shopify-events** using a date-based version.

## Generate version

1. Generate two version strings:
   - **Git tag:** Run `date +"%Y%m%d.%H%M"` to produce the tag version (e.g. `20260214.1230`). The git tag is `v` prefixed: `v20260214.1230`.
   - **Manifest version:** Run `date +"%Y.%m%d.%H%M"` to produce the manifest version (e.g. `2026.0214.1230`). Chrome requires 1-4 dot-separated integers each 0-65535, so the date must be split.

## Pre-flight checks

2. Verify the working tree is clean (`git status`). Abort if there are uncommitted changes.
3. Verify you are on the `main` branch. Abort if not.
4. Pull latest from origin to ensure you're up to date.

## Version bump

5. Read `manifest.json` and update the `"version"` field to the generated version.
6. Commit the version bump: `chore: release <version>`

## Tag and push

7. Create an annotated git tag: `v<version>`.
8. Push the commit and tag to origin.

## Generate release notes

9. Collect all commit messages since the previous tag (`git log <prev-tag>..HEAD --oneline`). If there is no previous tag, use all commits.
10. Group commits into categories based on their prefix:
    - **Features** — commits starting with `feature`, `feat`, `add`
    - **Fixes** — commits starting with `fix`, `bugfix`
    - **Other** — everything else
11. Create a GitHub release using `gh release create v<version>` with the generated notes. Mark it as latest.

## Post-release

12. Report the release URL to the user.
